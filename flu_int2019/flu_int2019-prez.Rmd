+ __digital resources support traditional research__
  + `r sm` respond to the needs of researchers
  + `r fr` possibilities of computational research untapped
+ __digital resources are dedicated to highly specialized topics__
  + `r sm` relevant to research questions
  + `r fr` limited reach
+ __digital resources are maintained by enthusiasts__
  + `r sm` sustainability despite underfunding

# State of affairs: bloom

.font140[
Consider the activities of the Department of _Comenius Studies and Early Modern Intellectual History_, which...


+ __digital resources support traditional research__
  + `r sm` ...publishes research that would not be feasible without computational methods
+ __digital resources are dedicated to highly specialized topics__
  + `r sm` ...has enlarged the pool of users by sharing national data internationally 
+ __digital resources are maintained by enthusiasts__
  + `r sm` ...draws support from foreign experts and develops its own expertise
+ __little awareness about standards and best practices__
  + `r fr` ...conforms with the state-of-the-art
  
For a similar example, _cf_. _Dictionary of Medieval Latin in the Czech Lands_

# State of affairs: note on the libraries and publishing

+ __Library of the Centre for Medievla Studies__
+ __Filosofia Publishing House__

.pull-right[


+ Institute of Philosophy runs 3 libraries, but there is no position of the digital librarian
+ libraries are not involved in digital humanities initiatives
+ our publishing house Filosofia has made efforts to digitize some books and, when possible, make them freely available online

# Digital research: computational analyses



.font140[

Computational research remains rare, but some examples can be provided:


+ Rhetorical strategies in Comenius's correspondence - did Comenius adapt writing style based on the addressees? (Storchová, L. & Urbánek, V.)
+ Frequency analysis and visualization of biblical quotations in Comenius's work (Havelka, T.)
+ Visualization methods for highly mobile correspondents (Urbánek, V.)
+ Personal networks and early-modern systems of patronage (Lelková, I.)
+ Knowledge representation using Transparent Intensional Logic as foundation for TIL-Script language in multi-agent models (Materna, P.)
+ Literary and scientific styles in Czech sociological writing (Hladík, R.)
+ Topic analysis of Czech sociological articles (Hladík, R.)

# Outlook

---

# Outlook

.font150[
+ postdoctoral position dedicated to the computational research in the humanities
+ project-based funding threatens sustainability 
+ adoption of Plan-S policies on national scale will affect the research outputs and will increase the role of digital repositories 
  + as a part of HR project (currently in the evaluation pipeline), questions of open access could gain an impetus in the near future

]

# Open questions

.font150[
+ How can we embed our resources and research in international networks?
    + Are there relevant EU-wide projects ongoing or about to be launched?
+ What good practices exist to enlarge and deepen digital research in the tradionally oriented humanities institutions?
  + Can we go beyond infrastructures?
+ How to bring focus to scattered researchers and topics?
+ How to reward labour-intensive digital initiatives in a research funding system that does not recognize digital outputs?
+ What are the experiences with funding for e-infrastructures at your institutions?
